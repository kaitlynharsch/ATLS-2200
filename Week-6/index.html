<h2>Welcome to The Hot Air Balloon Capital of the World!</h2>
<p>The beautiful city of Cappadocia in Tukey has been named the hot air balloon capital of the world! The very first balloon ride in Turkey was in 1991, and ever since then, the hot air balloon industry has increased in popularity immensely and has become the most popular attraction in the region!</p>
<p>More hot air balloons take off every single day than anywhere else in the world! Before the pandemic, the area averaged between 150 to 200 balloons in the air per day!</p>

<h2>Not Flying, but Floating</h2>
<p>You must understand that “flying” in a hot air balloon isn’t like flying in an airplane, because you can’t control where you go or land. You’re just floating where the wind takes you, which is pretty exciting.</p>
<p>These balloons can go as high as 3000 feet, depending on the weather.</p>
